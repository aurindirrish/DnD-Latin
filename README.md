# DnD-Latin
A Collection of Latin Incantations for DnD Spells.

# About
This repository documents my attempts at creating Latin phrases to be used as spell incantations for DnD Spells, so that my magic-phobic barbarian party members can enjoy a little more flavourful RP after I already spent two minutes picking said spell.

# Disclaimers
I've never taken a formal course in Latin, nor am I linguistically adept. *There will be mistakes* in grammar - such as in conjugation - and maybe even in the word selection itself - possibly due to homonyms. Take this as a chance to flavour your gameplay, but your mileage may vary depending on the Latin knowledge of your colleagues.

The inspiration for making a concrete quick-reference table of spells came from taking part in [Plom](https://www.plomlompom.de/) ([plomlompom](https://github.com/plomlompom))'s Seminar at Chaos Communication Camp 2023. Unlike me, they actually know what they are talking about.


For any sticklers who after all this still wish to complain about any errors, I implore you:

Seriously, let your hair down and make a PR.
